### üé¨ Demonstration

- Bubble-sort-Demo: [Bubble-sort]("http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif")


## Project Requirements

- Required to use yield inside method definition
- The block will have two arguments that represent the two elements of the array that are being compared
- The block‚Äôs return will be similar to the spaceship operator 
- Using the block‚Äôs return value to sort array
- We were required to test our method using
  > bubble_sort_by(["hi","hello","hey"]) do |left,right|
  >   left.length - right.length
  > end
  => ["hi", "hey", "hello"
